# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Greg

Once a developer at heart â€” from Symbian intern to tech lead building SaaS platforms from ground up. 

Now steering the ship as CEO of [Black Label](https://www.blacklabel.net) â€” experts in building high-performance data visualization-rich interfaces and apps.

Also, once a startup founder, now backing people like my younger self â€” through VCs and as an angel investor.

Sad but true â€” GitHub isnâ€™t my hangout anymore. These days youâ€™re more likely to bump into me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grzegorziwacz/).
